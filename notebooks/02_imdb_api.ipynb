His opening takes shots at the Covid pandemic and he does it in humorous fashion, something you think would be difficult but he makes it look easy. From there he riffs on parades with marching bands, organized religion, bikers, and billionaire astronauts who are 'doing it so we can too'. Parenting gets the treatment too, a topic he usually ventures into, but I was surprised he didn't skewer some of his favorite topics like eating and exercising. One he loves, the other he hates, you can figure it out. I have to say, the guy went well out of his way to get a laugh when he sat down at the piano. That was inspired. I'll admit, Gaffigan's been funnier in prior specials, but I'll still take him over the crude performances that most other stand-ups try to pass off as comedy. Every other sentence punctuated with a four letter word isn't what I tune in to watch and hear.\"},\n",

As always he reflects on his life as a father of 5, a husband, an entertainer, and a devote lover of food. This is an intelligent and mature comedy special. Jim does not go for the shock, or the cheap laughs. He is very self-effacing and he does it well. One of things I truly admire about him is his ability to continuously churn out good and relevant content. HIs humor is adult, and by that I don't mean sexual or blue- it is adult because his perspective lands best with people that are in relationships and can relate to the experience of kids. This one is great because it provide social commentary without political divisiveness. He is very well researched in his approach to the material; for example-he jokes about marching bands but understands them really well.\"},\n",

Some people look for ways to use their favorite words like 'cringe' and 'beta male' and 'cucky' - all in an effort to make themselves appear 'alpha'. And in so doing, they dismiss an entire hour+ or material as 'men bad/women great'. That's not even REMOTELY what this special is. Ignore the inane psuedo political rantings of people who continue to use the words 'cringe' as though it's an adjective. Because it isn't. No matter how often hipster posers try to use it that way.\"},\n",

I'm all for edgy comedy considering my favorite comedians are bill burr and Louis CK this special was just not funny in the slightest. Overall if you want a family friendly comedy special that won't make you laugh at all this is perfect for you. I just don't think he will ever live up to his old specials anymore....\"},\n",
